Foundry

A suite of applications to augment the use of apollo printers.
+ slicer / gcode ide 
+ host
+ lab (fleet)

Designed as a collection of applications rather than a monolithic app to follow the line of bounded contexts. When you do so, issues of synchronizing releases are often immediately solved.

The architecture included both REST and event-driven (over WS) elements. The two were divided along bounded context of the host app and all others.
