Mistranslation of Religion
 
Jesus came from nothing. There was nothing, then something.

The development of the world, as told by god, are akin to the growth of
inteliigent life on earth.

The story of jesus is interesting in a number of ways. Is he a representation
of the beginning - something from nothing. Or, is he indicative of a restart.
