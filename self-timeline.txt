2017
- rethink robotics - started as UI engineer - worked on Intera robot training software. This was an event driven progressive web application written using React. We were working to make it extensible to more than the Sawyer cobot - think robot operating system. I led the team creating a mobile training toolkit. I introduced componentization to the team, these were the first steps towards a design system. One of the pain points for the team was the relationship with UX, this came as a surprise to me, as I was fond of thinking of the problem of the UX team expressing their ideas. Led the hackathon cloud intera effort.
