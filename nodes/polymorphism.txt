Polymorphism

The idea of representing multiple concepts with the same interface.

This can be achieved in three primary ways,
1. Overloading 
Having a function with multiple signatures, each defining different types of arguments.

2. Generics
Having a function with a signature that includes generic types.

3. Subtyping
Having multiple interfaces derived from the same underlying interface.
