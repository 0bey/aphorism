UI engineer at rethink robotics

Worked on Intera robot training software. This was an event driven progressive web application written using React. We were working to make it extensible to more than the Sawyer cobot - think robot operating system. 

I led the team creating a mobile training toolkit. 

I introduced componentization to the team, these were the first steps towards a design system. One of the pain points for the team was the relationship with UX, this came as a surprise to me, as I was fond of thinking of the problem of the UX team expressing their ideas. 

Led the hackathon cloud intera effort. This was a cloud, or site, deployed application for managing the activities of a fleet of robots.
